# Work & Business Helper Scripts

This repository collects small, pragmatic scripts we use to automate day-to-day work and business tasks.  
Each tool lives in its own subfolder and is self-contained. Typical use cases include document distribution,
file housekeeping, lightweight reporting, and small data transformations.

> Every subfolder has (or should have) its own README with setup and usage details.

## Quick Start
1. Open a subfolder.
2. Read its README.


## Requirements
- Any script-specific dependencies are documented in the subfolder README.

## Security
- Provide secrets via environment variables or a local `.env` (not committed).
- Never commit credentials, tokens, or private data to the repository.
